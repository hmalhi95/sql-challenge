# SQL Challenge

## Data Modeling
After inspecting the CSV files I created the ERD below

## Data Engineering
I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files and imported the CSV files into the correct SQL tables.

## Data Analysis
Once the CSVs were uploaded into the tables I was able to create the following lists:
- Employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- First name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- Manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- Department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- First name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
